Silver Squad Studios project "Scroll"\

This repository is for SilverSquadStudios for the Uncommon Hacks 2018 Competition. This is for the scroll application which is an application that
was created to help Blind or Deaf individuals whom have a tough time in class room lecture halls. This Application records the teachers screen, teachers voice and transcribes said audio into
subtitles that allow deaf individuals to see what the professor is saying as appose to having a professional come in and hand type everything the 
professor says. This will also save all lectures in one folder for anyone to look back into later on.

Thank You!
